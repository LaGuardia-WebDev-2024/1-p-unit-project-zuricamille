  <h2>Why Fashion is Imporant ðŸ¤¨</h2>
  Fashion is a
  <em>big</em>
  part of our identities! Fashion is so important for 4 main reasons;
  <strong>Self-Expresion, Cultural Reflection, Economic Impact, and Historical Signifigance .</strong>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><strong>Self Expression</strong>: It allows individuals to express their identity, beliefs, and creativity. What we wear can communicate our personality and values without saying a word.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Cultural Expression</strong>: Fashion often reflects societal trends and cultural shifts. It can highlight important social issues and movements, making it a powerful tool for commentary and change.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Economic Connection</strong>: The fashion industry is a major economic driver, providing millions of jobs worldwide and contributing significantly to global economies.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Historical Signifigance</strong>: Fashion can be a window into history, showcasing the evolution of styles, materials, and cultural influences over time.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Lets Find <em>Your</em> StyleðŸ‘ 
    </h2>
  Self expression is so important! The first thing people notice about you when you enter a space is not only how you look but how you dress, and from there people will have assumptions about you. Whether you like it or not you are judged first soley on your appearance, so my motto; Dress how you want to be adressed! The way you carry yourself and the way you dress says so much about you, so be intentional with how you carry yourself and take pride in how you dress. If you haven't found your style yet that's perfectly fine, you can get inspiration from others, you can experiment and just dress how you feel, you can even create your own style because you never know where that could take you!
